        <h2>About Taninwat Kaewpankan (Ice)</h2>
        <p>
        Hello there! I'm Taninwat, but feel free to call me Ice. 
        Born in the vibrant heart of Bangkok, Thailand, my life's journey has taken me across the globe, from the serene landscapes of Sweden, where I've spent over a decade, to my current pursuit of setting roots in the dynamic environment of Denmark. 
        This blend of cultures and experiences has shaped my perspective, fueling my passion for front-end development and a keen interest in the transformative potential of Bitcoin.
        </p>

        <h2>Education & Growth</h2>
        <p>
        My academic path began at Uppsala University, Sweden, where I immersed myself in the world of Game Design and Project Management, earning a Bachelor of Arts. 
        This experience was more than academic; it was a creative exploration, particularly through projects like "Fly Away" and "Armored Division," and a thesis that delved into VR technology's intriguing challenges. 
        My quest for knowledge didn't stop there. 
        I pursued a Master's in Entrepreneurship, diving deep into the human elements of business and conducting a thesis on entrepreneurial learning in business incubators, a study deeply rooted in the Swedish entrepreneurial ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Strides</h2>
        <p>
        Professionally, my journey has been diverse and enriching. 
        From a Business Development Intern at Spreadly in Munich, where I honed my market research and strategy skills, to my current role in the Operations Team at Millennial Consulting in Copenhagen, I've embraced a spectrum of experiences. 
        In Copenhagen, I blend project management with the unique task of connecting ambitious student consultants with local businesses, a role that's a perfect symphony of strategy, management, and innovation.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
        <p>
        My fluency in Thai, English, and Swedish is a testament to my ability to adapt and thrive in multicultural settings. 
        Technically, I'm proficient in tools like Jira, Trello, and GitHub, and I'm continually expanding my skillset in web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        This learning journey is a crucial step toward my goal of becoming a skilled front-end developer, blending my creativity with technical expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
        <p>
        When I'm not immersed in entrepreneurial ventures or gaming worlds, I'm exploring the outdoors, capturing moments through my lens, or delving into the world of editing and design. 
        Each of these hobbies is a reflection of my love for creativity and innovation. 
        While my past experience with tools like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro has faded, my current focus aligns more closely with my aspirations in web development and digital storytelling. 
        Outside of my professional pursuits, I find joy in reading and learning more about Bitcoin as it teachs not only technology such as Blockchain rather it also teaches me about the view of politics, economics, personal finanace and philosophy.
        I also find joy in travelling, and exploring the realms of business fields.
        </p>

        <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>
        <p>
        I am driven by the belief that every day brings new opportunities for growth, creativity, and making a positive impact. 
        I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations to create meaningful, innovative solutions together. 
        Let's embark on this journey and craft impactful stories in the digital world!
